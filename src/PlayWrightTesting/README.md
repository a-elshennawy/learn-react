it's another E2E methiod but with cross browser testing ability supporting more modern browsers than cypress

1- npm init playwright@latest to install and initialize setup
it will :
a- sets up a Playwright configuration file (playwright.config.js).
b- creates a basic example test. (we deleted it)
c- downloads the browser binaries necessary to run your tests.
d- adds a test script to your package.json file

be aware in steUp it will ask you about GitHub Actions workflow (important !!!)
A GitHub Actions workflow is an automated process that runs a series of tasks whenever a specific event occurs in your GitHub repository, such as a code push, a pull request, or a scheduled time. It's a key part of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).

In your case, when you set up Playwright, it asks if you want to add a workflow to run your tests automatically. This means that every time you push new code to your repository, a GitHub server will automatically run your Playwright tests to ensure that your changes haven't introduced any bugs. If a test fails, GitHub will notify you, preventing broken code from being merged into your main branch.

note: after it finishes it will create many folder but your customized tests goes in (test) and you can have a look on the examples it created for more understanding

2- let's start by writing our first test in the folder called (tests) created in root of your project by creating Counter.spec.js in the tests folder and importing the Counter.jsx in app.jsx as it tests app.jsx just like cypress (syntax is a bit different but same logic)

3- testing ?
a- making sure u did the npm run dev and in your package.json make sure in scripts you have "test:e2e": "playwright test" then npm test:e2e
or you can simply do
npx playwright test

b- to see the tests run in a real browser, use the --headed flag:
npx playwright test --headed

c- You can also open the UI mode to interactively debug your tests
npx playwright test --ui
